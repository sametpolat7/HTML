# NOTES
## Headings
- Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

## Paragraphs
- With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
- The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.

## Formatting
- The HTML &lt;strong&gt; element defines text with strong importance. And this word is searched in the search engine.
- A screen reader will pronounce the words in &lt;em&gt; with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

## Attributes
1. ### The title attributes
- The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
- The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element.

**Example** ` <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p> `

## Quotation
- The HTML &lt;blockquote&gt; element defines a section that is quoted from another source. Browsers usually indent &lt;blockquote&gt; elements.
- The HTML &lt;abbr&gt; tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
