# HTML Semantic Elements
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.


Examples of non-semantic elements: `<div>` and `<span>` - Tells nothing about its content.


Examples of semantic elements: `<form>`, `<table>`, and `<article>` - Clearly defines its content.
